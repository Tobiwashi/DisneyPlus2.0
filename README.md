I. Overview

I decided to create this app because I wanted to reinforce my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and React. I also wanted to incorporate popular tools I'm not very familiar with as well such as Redux, Firebase, and Styled Components. I've always had an interest in Disney's work and I thought what better way to learn than to build something that I already have an interest for!!!

This app will replicate all of the basic functionality of Disney+ Excluding the streaming services. Users will be allowed to Login/Signup and browse through a dynamically loaded array of media.

This app will be made using Javascript on the Client-Side, specifically React and React add-ons such as React-Router-Dom and Redux. The Backend will be Powered by Fire Base. 

II. Responsiveness 

I've made 3 breakpoints in the 'index.css' folder the first being min-width 768px to accomodate for the average laptop/desktop screen. The second being a min-width 480px and max-width 768 px for the average smartphone. And one for sub 480px px devices such as smartwatches.
